This chapter will introduce some of the theory behind max-sum problems, \glspl{csp} and related fields.
There are significant similarities between these two problems, and a detailed translation of \gls{csp} (and similar problems) to equivalent max-sum formulations will be provided.
This translation will be used to apply the in-the-middle algorithm to \glspl{csp}.

With this background given, the in-the-middle algorithm will be introduced. First, the original \gls{lp} formulation will be briefly described.
Then, the max-sum variant will be thoroughly explained\footnote{The algorithm will be described in theory, with practical implementation issues and considerations being discussed in the next chapter.}, and several extensions and modifications of the algorithm will be introduced.
Finally, the theoretical framework surrounding the algorithm will be compared to theoretical results in a \gls{csp} context.
