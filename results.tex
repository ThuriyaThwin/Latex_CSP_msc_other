This chapter will review the results of the benchmark, and compare these to previous results due to \textcite{deGivry14}.
Results from two modified variants, using the \enquote{push} operation and using the greedy DP update, will also be reviewed and compared to the benchmark of the standard algorithm.
Problem sets which yield good performance will be identified and examined further.
