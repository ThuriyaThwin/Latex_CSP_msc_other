This chapter will review the results of the benchmark, and compare these to previous results due to \textcite{deGivry14}.
Results from two modified variants, using the \enquote{push} operation and using the greedy DP update, will also be reviewed and compared to the benchmark of the standard algorithm.
Problem sets which yield good performance will be identified and examined further.

The chapter is divided into three parts.
First, benchmarking results of the standard in-the-middle algorithm will be presented.
Then, results from both modified variants will be presented along with the chosen subset of benchmarking problems applied to these specific variants.
Finally, the results are discussed and interpreted in further depth.
