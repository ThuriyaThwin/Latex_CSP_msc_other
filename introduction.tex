This thesis will expand a known \acrlong{lp} omptimization algorithm which has seen extensive use in industry, the in-the-middle algorithm\footnote{Originally proposed by \textcite{Wedelin95}.} (and its accompanying heuristic), to a wider set of problems in \acrlong{cp} and \acrlong{csp}.
This will be done by applying a recently developed reformulation of the algorithm which applies to max-sum problems, with a suitable transformation of \acrlong{cp} and \acrlong{csp} instances into max-sum instances.

An implementation of this reformulated algorithm will be implemented and benchmarked against solvers in the \acrlong{cp} and \acrlong{csp} fields.
This will provide valuable insights which will determine the usefulness of this reformulated algorithm in the fields previously mentioned.
