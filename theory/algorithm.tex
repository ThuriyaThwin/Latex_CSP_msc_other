\subsection{Improvements}


\subsubsection{The \enquote{push} operation}
In their asessment of the in-the-middle algorithm, \textcite{Bastert10} introduce a number of generalizations and improvements.
One of these improvements is the so-called \enquote{push} operation.
The idea of the push operation is to guide the algorithm toward better solutions after a first feasible solution is found.

Since the algorithm with its heuristic is approximative, any feasible solution found is only guaranteed to be optimal for \(\bar{c}\), \emph{i.e.} the modified cost vector.
\Citeauthor{Bastert10} define the \enquote{push} operation \parencite[\pno~100]{Bastert10} as setting \(\bar{c} \leftarrow \bar{c} + \rho c\) for some parameter \(\rho\) whenever a feasible solution is found, then continuing to run the algorithm for at least 50 iterations.
Additionally, the parameter \(\kappa\) used in the algorithm is reduced by a factor in the push operation.

The push operation is in essence a local search.
When a feasible solution to the approximative problem (as generated by the heuristic) is found, that solution is used as a starting point for a less aggressive heuristic or the exact algorithm on the original problem.

For max-sum problems, the original vector \(c\) will always be all-zero.
Therefore, the push operation is implemented as setting \(\bar{c} \leftarrow c\), which is roughly equivalent to \(\rho=\infty\).
The parameter \(\kappa\) is multiplied by a factor \num{0.8}.
