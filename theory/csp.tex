\section{Constraint Satisfaction Problems}
As detailed in the introduction, \glspl{csp} occur in may settings and 
various forms. In general, however, one may define a \gls{csp} as a
mathematical problem defined by a set of objects whose state must
satisfy a number of constraints or limitations, and (in the weighted case)
in which preferences among the solutions may be expressed.
This definition is extremely general and covers a wide range of problems,
such as the \emph{\(n\) queens puzzle}, \emph{map coloring}, and
\emph{resource allocation}.

Formally, a \gls{csp} is defined by
