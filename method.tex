In this chapter, specific implementation details relating to the algorithm as used in the benchmark will be presented.
This includes considerations which are of great importance when implementing efficient variants of the algorithm, including memory considerations as well as computational ones.
The implementation details are intended to facilitate independent implementations of the algorithm.

Additionally, the method used in the benchmark will be explained (including hardware used).
The problem sets used in the benchmark will be introduced, including a short background and some characteristics of each set.
Finally, the other solvers used in the benchmark will be briefly introduced including a short review of their underlying algorithms.
